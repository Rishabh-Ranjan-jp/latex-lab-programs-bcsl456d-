		In Adhoc Networks, routing protocols are crucial for data transmission. These networks form temporary connections between nodes that move randomly, often requiring multiple hops due to limited transmission range. This paper analyzes and simulates a proposed WLAN using different routing protocols, comparing their performance with metrics such as delay, throughput, packet delivery, load, and Ethernet delay using the OPNET simulator.
