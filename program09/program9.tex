	\section{Introduction}
	In Adhoc Networks, routing protocols are crucial for group communication and data transmission \cite{hardtoshare}. Wireless networks form temporary connections between nodes, with each node changing locations over time. Multiple hops are required for communication due to the limited transmission range \cite{resource}. This paper analyzes and compares the performance of different routing protocols in a simulated Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using the OPNET simulator. Key metrics such as delay, throughput, and packet delivery are evaluated.
